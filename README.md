# 10_minute_walk

## Take a ten minute walk
It's an app which takes the array of directions and returns true if:
* The walk will take 10 minutes
* You will return to the original location

## Scenario
You are meeting a friend in Imaginary City, where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to the appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk.
The city provides its tourists with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk. eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']

You always walk one block at a time in a direction and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise.


## Examples of use
ten_minute_walk?(['w', 's', 'e', 'e', 'n', 'n', 'e', 's', 'w', 'w']) # => true
ten_minute_walk?(['w', 's', 'e', 'n', 'n', 'e', 's', 'w', 'w', 'w']) # => false
ten_minute_walk?(['w', 's', 'e', 's', 's', 'e', 's', 'w', 'n', 'n']) # => false
ten_minute_walk?(['w', 's']) # => false

## Set Up

You will need a REPL like IRB to run this programme.
If you want to see the tests pass you will need to have ruby and rspec installed.
